>"What is learning? Acquiring knowledge and skills and having them readily available from memory so you can make sense of future problems and opportunities."

Factors of learning:
1. Learning requires *memory*
2. Learning is a lifelong endeavor
3. Learning is an acquired skill, and the most effective strategies are often not intuitive

Learning is deeper and more durable when it's *effortful*.

Contrary to many learners' belief, rereading and plain writting what we learn are not effective methods (not intuitive ha?). Instead, recalling facts from our memory in an *spaced out* manner is the way to make it stick! The neural pathways (which are the embodiment what has been learned) get stronger when memory is retrieved and the learning is practiced.

We have two types of practices, massed and interleaved/varied. Massed practice is when we go through a subject all at once and interleaved/varied practice is when we change the subject that we are working on every once in a while. The latter helps us to identify the solutions (usually mixed types) in an unfamiliar situation, same as real life.

> The elements that shape our intellectual abilities lie with in our own control. Understanding this, enables us to see failure as a badge of effort and a source of useful information - the need to dig deeper or try a different strategy. When learning is hard, we are doing important work. Striving and setback are essential if we are to surpass our current level of performance toward true expertise. **Making mistakes and correcting them builds the bridge to advanced learning**

Research says that the knowledge gained from rereading is transistory and it is bad for three reasons: it is time consuming, it does not result in durable memory, and it deceives us into thinking that getting familiar with the text is the same as knowing the content. *The amount of study time is no measure of mastery*

**Learning is stronger when it matters, when it is personal.**

* Mere repetition does not enhance learning. In fact, it makes sense to reread a text once if there has been a meaningful lapse of time since the first reading, but multiple rereadings in close succession, is more time-consuming than useful.

**The illusions of knowing**: Some learners think that the essense of the subject lies in the syntax in which it is described. Mastering the text is not the same as mastering the ideas behind them. Just because we are following a subject (a lecture, a book, etc.) with ease, does not mean we are mastering it. This is an example of poor metacognition, we don't know what we don't know.

> Detour: What is metacognition? Metacognition is, put simply, thinking about one’s thinking.  More precisely, it refers to the processes used to plan, monitor, and assess one’s understanding and performance. Metacognition includes a critical awareness of a) one’s thinking and learning and b) oneself as a thinker and learner [1].

**Testing: Scary or Helpful?**: It would be helpful to think of _testing_ as a method to retrieve information from our memory rather than a _test_ to evaluate our knowledge. First, testing helps us understand which part of each subject we did quite get, so we can study more. Second, recalling what we learned strengthen our memory. **In effect, it is a way to stop forgetting what we have learned.**
