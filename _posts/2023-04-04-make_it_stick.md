>"What is learning? Acquiring knowledge and skills and having them readily available from memory so you can make sense of future problems and opportunities."

Factors of learning:
1. Learning requires *memory*
2. Learning is a lifelong endeavor
3. Learning is an acquired skill, and the most effective strategies are often not intuitive

Learning is deeper and more durable when it's *effortful*.

Contrary to many learners' belief, rereading and plain writting what we learn are not effective methods (not intuitive ha?). Instead, recalling facts from our memory in an *spaced out* manner is the way to make it stick! The neural pathways (which are the embodiment what has been learned) get stronger when memory is retrieved and the learning is practiced.

We have two types of practices, massed and interleaved/varied. Massed practice is when we go through a subject all at once and interleaved/varied practice is when we change the subject that we are working on every once in a while. The latter helps us to identify the solutions (usually mixed types) in an unfamiliar situation, same as real life.

> The elements that shape our intellectual abilities lie with in our own control. Understanding this, enables us to see failure as a badge of effort and a source of useful information - the need to dig deeper or try a different strategy. When learning is hard, we are doing important work. Striving and setback are essential if we are to surpass our current level of performance toward true expertise. **Making mistakes and correcting them builds the bridge to advanced learning**
